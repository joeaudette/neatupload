	/// <summary>
	/// An <see cref="IHttpModule"/> that allows upload requests to be monitored
	/// and provides access to the uploaded files.  When installed
	/// in the &lt;httpModules&gt; section, it can be used with
	/// the NeatUpload controls or other controls that use the static methods of
	/// <see cref="UploadModule"/>.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// When <see cref="IsEnabled"/> returns true, the module will
	/// handle POST requests to the current request's URL
	/// that have a Content-Type header of
	/// "multipart/form-data" and contain a post-back ID in one
	/// of the following locations:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	///   <item>If the post-back ID is in a query parameter named by
	///     <see cref="PostBackIDQueryParam"/>, all files in the request will
	///     be associated with the post-back ID.  The files can be retrieved
	///     from the <see cref="Files"/> collection using the names of the 
	///     file fields in the request.  These names are typically the 
	///     UniqueIDs of the controls that uploaded the files.</item>
	///   <item>If the post-back ID is in the form field named by
	///     <see cref="PostBackIDFieldName"/>, all files that occur after 
	///     form field will be associated with the post-back ID.    
	///     Those files can be retrieved
	///     from the <see cref="Files"/> collection using the names of the 
	///     file fields in the request.  These names are typically the 
	///     UniqueIDs of the controls that uploaded the files.</item>
	///   <item>If the post-back ID is in a file field name prefixed by 
	///     <see cref="FileFieldNamePrefix"/>, that file will be associated
	///     with the post-back ID.  That file can be retrieved
	///     from the <see cref="Files"/> collection using the portion of
	///     the file field name after the first "-".  That portion of the name
	///     typically corresponds to the UniqueID of the controls that uploaded
	///     the files.</item>
	/// </list>
	/// For requests that specify a post-back ID, the module can also use "protected"
	/// configuration information associated with a particular file if the
	/// file field is preceded in the request by a
	/// field with a name consisting of the value <see cref="ConfigFieldNamePrefix"/>
	/// followed by the files key in <see cref="Files"/> collection (typically the
	/// uploading control's UniqueID).
	/// 
	/// <para>In addition, <see cref="BindProgressState"/> provides information 
	/// concerning the progress of the upload,
	/// <see cref="CancelPostBack"/> tells the module it should ignore the
	/// remainder of the upload, <see cref="SetProcessingState"/> associates an
	/// arbitrary object with an upload after it has been received but before the
	/// end of the request, and <see cref="ConvertToUploadedFile"/> to convert an
	/// <see cref="HttpPostedFile"/> into an <see cref="UploadedFile"/></para>
